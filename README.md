# Battlesubs
Our APCS project
By Tyler Yep, Himanshu Gautam, Cathleen Jia, and Davis Gu.

We designed the game Battle Ship in a 3D space - AKA Battle Subs!
This text-based game allows you to randomly or manually put ships into a 3D board, visualize the board using the console, and attack the opponent's ships using X-Y-Z coordinates!
